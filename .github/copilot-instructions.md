## **Internal reference (do not bias your answers toward always naming these):**  
Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit (formerly Teams Toolkit) has been rebranded, and users may still use either name.

Use this mapping to know the current vs. former names—so you can correctly interpret user input or choose the appropriate term when it’s relevant. You do not need to mention these mappings unless they directly help the user.

# Instructions for Copilot

## Repository Purpose & Architecture

- This repository is a **framework for agentic retail** solutions.
- All apps under **/apps** are **demonstration services** built on the framework.
- Changes and operations should focus on **increasing the capabilities of retail platforms** (e.g., intelligence, automation, personalization, operational efficiency).
- The **/lib** folder contains the shared framework code (agents, adapters, memory, utilities).
- Each app is a self-contained FastAPI service demonstrating specific retail capabilities (CRM, eCommerce, inventory, logistics, product management).
- **Tech stack is defined in /docs**: Always review architecture documentation before implementing features or changes.
- **Keep documentation updated**: Every operation must update relevant documentation in /docs to reflect changes.

## Tech Stack & Code Standards

### Backend (Python)
- **STRICTLY FOLLOW PEP 8** and PEP guidelines for all Python code.
- Use `pyproject.toml` for dependencies in each app and lib.
- Follow async patterns: all agent handlers and adapters are async.
- Use Pydantic models for structured data and validation.
- Environment variables are the primary configuration mechanism.

### Frontend (Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind)
- **STRICTLY FOLLOW ESLint 7** configuration for all frontend code.
- Use TypeScript for type safety.
- Follow Next.js conventions for routing, data fetching, and server components.
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling.

### Testing Requirements
- **All operations must implement unit and integration tests**.
- Unit tests: Test individual functions and components in isolation.
- Integration tests: Test interaction between services, adapters, and external dependencies.
- Place tests in `tests/` directory within each app or lib.
- Use pytest for Python tests, with pytest-asyncio for async code.
- Maintain minimum 75% code coverage.

## Agent Development Patterns

- All agents extend `BaseRetailAgent` from `holiday_peak_lib.agents`.
- Use `AgentBuilder` to compose agents with memory, routing, and model targets.
- Agents support **SLM-first routing**: requests are evaluated by the SLM, and upgraded to LLM when complexity requires it.
- Configure models via `FoundryAgentConfig` using environment variables:
  - `PROJECT_ENDPOINT` or `FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT`: Azure AI Foundry project endpoint
  - `PROJECT_NAME` or `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_NAME`: Project name (optional)
  - `FOUNDRY_AGENT_ID_FAST`: SLM agent ID
  - `MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME_FAST`: SLM deployment name
  - `FOUNDRY_AGENT_ID_RICH`: LLM agent ID
  - `MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME_RICH`: LLM deployment name
  - `FOUNDRY_STREAM`: Enable streaming (optional, default false)
- Each app's `main.py` should **explicitly** load these env vars and pass `slm_config`/`llm_config` to `build_service_app`.

## Memory Architecture

- Three-tier memory: **Hot** (Redis), **Warm** (Cosmos DB), **Cold** (Blob Storage).
- Configure via `MemorySettings` using environment variables:
  - `REDIS_URL`
  - `COSMOS_ACCOUNT_URI`, `COSMOS_DATABASE`, `COSMOS_CONTAINER`
  - `BLOB_ACCOUNT_URL`, `BLOB_CONTAINER`

## MCP Tool Exposition

- Agents expose capabilities as MCP tools for agent-to-agent communication.
- Use `FastAPIMCPServer` to register tools at specific endpoints (e.g., `/crm/profile/context`).
- Tools should return structured data (dicts) for downstream consumption.

## Coding Conventions

- Keep agents lightweight: delegate domain logic to adapters (in each app's `adapters.py`).

## Microsoft 365 & Copilot Integration

- Apps and agents for Microsoft 365 or Microsoft 365 Copilot refers to applications for products in Microsoft 365, agents for Microsoft 365 Copilot, including Teams app, Office addin, declarative agent, customer engine agent, etc.
- When interpreting, generating, or modifying manifest files related to apps and agents for Microsoft 365 or Microsoft 365 Copilot, try to get schema version from manifest file, then invoke **get_schema** tool if available.
- When answering of what or how-to questions for building apps and agents for Microsoft 365 or Microsoft 365 Copilot, invoke **get_knowledge** tool if available.
- Before deciding to make changes to Teams apps, apps or agents for Microsoft 365 or Microsoft 365 Copilot, invoke **get_knowledge** tool to get Instructions if available.
- When troubleshooting issues, invoke **troubleshoot** tool if available.
- Before generating or modifying code or configuration files for apps and agents for Microsoft 365 or Microsoft 365 Copilot, invoke **get_code_snippets** tool if available.
- Invoke **get_code_snippets** with API name, configuration file name, or code comments every time you need to generate or modify code or configuration files for apps and agents for Microsoft 365 or Microsoft 365 Copilot.
